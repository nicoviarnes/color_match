	Game Mechanics:
		- The game will present a grid of colored objects (e.g., squares, circles, or tiles) on the screen.
		- The player's task is to click or tap on pairs of adjacent objects that have the same color to make them disappear.
		- When a pair of matching objects is clicked, they should vanish from the grid, and the remaining objects should fall down to fill the empty space.
		- The game can have different levels or stages, each with a progressively larger grid or more challenging time limits.

	Game Elements:
		- Colored objects: Create various colored sprites or shapes to represent the objects on the grid. Each object should have a specific color assigned to it.
		- Time limit: Set a countdown timer for each level to add a sense of urgency to the gameplay. The player must complete the level before time runs out.
		- Score: Keep track of the player's score based on the number of matches they make. Display the score on the screen to provide feedback to the player.

	User Interface:
		- Start screen: Design a simple start screen with options to start a new game or access game settings.
		- Game screen: Display the grid of colored objects, the countdown timer, and the player's score.
		- End screen: Show the player's final score and provide an option to play again or return to the start screen.

	Sound Effects and Visual Feedback:
		- Add sound effects to indicate successful matches, such as a chime or a satisfying "pop" sound when objects disappear.
		- Provide visual feedback when the player makes a match, such as a temporary highlight or animation around the matched objects.
